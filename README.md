 ## Project Overview

For this internship task at Prodigy Infotech, My main focus was on developing machine learning models to forecast whether clients would subscribe to a term deposit. The models were built using demographic and behavioral data obtained from direct marketing campaigns implemented by a Portuguese banking institution.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project was to construct predictive models capable of aiding banking institutions in targeting clients with a higher propensity to subscribe to term deposits. Accurately identifying potential subscribers enables the institution to enhance its marketing strategies and elevate campaign efficacy.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project pertains to the direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) conducted by the Portuguese banking institution. It encompasses a variety of features, including client demographics, previous marketing interactions, and the campaign outcome indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit or not. You can access the dataset [here](https://github.com/saivardhan507/PRODIGY_DS_03/blob/b4ab53d0bb78b2d2d7ba3b871c869d0fbcad2ac5/bank-additional-full.csv). 



 ### Results

- The project successfully developed decision tree classifiers using both the Gini impurity and entropy criteria.
- The models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting term deposit subscriptions, with the Gini impurity criterion slightly outperforming the entropy criterion in terms of testing accuracy and recall for the positive class.

### Conclusion

The project highlights the potential of machine learning models in predicting term deposit subscriptions within direct marketing campaigns. Through the application of predictive analytics, the banking institution can refine its marketing strategies and elevate customer engagement.
